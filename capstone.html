    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>I have decided that I will attempt to train an ML model to detect phishing attacks. Depending on how difficult the implementation takes, I may increase scope to analyze pcap files for signs of attack. I would also like to build a UI for the applicatiuon, something I haven't done before.</p>
    <p>The first step will be to determine which libraries and datasets I will use for this, after which we can begin feature engineering and preliminary training on the datasets.</p>
